	/**
	 * Creates an object that interfaces to an OperationEngine.
	 *
	 * The public API is as follows:
	 *
	 *  - {JSON object} createOp(name, value, type, position)
	 *    Applications must call this to create an opaque object that the
	 *    OTEngine can understand. Specifically, calls to localEvent require
	 *    as an argument an object returned from createOp.
	 *
	 *  - {JSON object} localEvent(op):
	 *    Local peers must call this when a local data structure has changed.
	 *    The returned JSON object should be forwarded to remote peers
	 *    unchanged.
	 *
	 *  - {JSON object} remoteEvent(op, order):
	 *    Local peers must call this to have the local engine process a remote
	 *    peer's change. The JSON object passed to remoteEvent must be the
	 *    exact JSON object returned by the remote peer's call to localEvent.
	 *    Furthermore, remoteEvent takes a second integer argument that
	 *    specifies the given operation's total order. Typically, some central
	 *    server will decide the total order. The total order must be provided
	 *    by the application of this OT API by some unspecified means.
	 *
	 *  - {JSON object} syncOutbound(void):
	 *    This should be called periodically by the application to retrieve
	 *    local internal engine state (context vector). The returned object
	 *    must be forwarded to all other remote peers. The suggested interval
	 *    for calling this method is every ten seconds.
	 *
	 *  - void syncInbound(site, state):
	 *    Applications should call this method when they receive a remote
	 *    peer's internal engine state (the context vector returned from the
	 *    remote peer's syncOutbound call).
	 *
	 *  - boolean purge(void):
	 *    Applications should call this to purge internal engine state. The
	 *    engine's history buffer is garbage collected. Returns whether or not
	 *    the engine was purged.
	 *
	 *  - boolean isStable(void):
	 *    Returns whether or not the OTEngine is in a "valid" state. This means
	 *    whether or not calls to localEvent, etc will continue to succeed.
	 *    If the engine is not in a valid state, then calling localEvent, etc
	 *    will be a noop. An invalid state means that the local data can no
	 *    longer guaranteed to be in sync with that of remote peers.
	 *
	 *    TODO provide API examples
